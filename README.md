# NOP100

NOP100 is a generic NMEA2000 module that implements and abstracts
most of the housekeeping functions necessary to build a working
NMEA2000 module

The functionality required to implement a particular module
application is abstracted out into a small collection of include
files which allow even quite complex functions to be built with a
minimum of code.
